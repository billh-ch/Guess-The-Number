# Guess The Number

This is a simple game made with Tkinter in Python. The game is pretty simple. Select your difficulty, the default one is "Normal 0-100". Tap randomize and a random number is generated. After that you enter your guess in the entry (the white space). How many guesses you have made is being show in the bottom. If your guessed number is above the generated number, a down arrow appears in the screen. If your guessed number is bellow the generated number, an up arrow appears in the screen. If you guess the number a check appears in the screen. Congrats! You played the game! If you want to exit the game just press "Exit" and you're good to go. Also if you want a hint to see what numbers you have already guessed, hold CNTRL and see the numbers you have guessed.
